Title: IS IT OUR FATE?

My visual argument I have created via GIMP represents an issue we face today corresponding to the pollution in the ocean. With so many problems due to the trash in the ocean we as people have caused, not only is it hurting the animals who live there, but is it hurting us, too? What they eat, we eat. Is this enough, now, to convince us to clean up our oceans?
