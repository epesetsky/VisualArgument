Prospective assets: 


-Image of turtle shell in ocean (if not in ocean, will layer to appear so)

-Images of pollution (including bottles, plastic straws, plastic bags, and cigarettes)

I plan to obtain these photographs from sites like unsplash.com where photographers post their images for everyone to use.
