After watching numerous GIMP tutorials, I feel like I am getting the hang of the application a bit more. I understood that in order to remove the background for the plastic bag, I needed to add an “alpha layer” which finally allowed me to completed erase the background to those gray tiles rather than black or white. That was my first step toward progress. With this, I was able to erase the background, add the image clip onto the fish in water, and even add my text on top of that. With this, half of my visual argument was complete. 

Now, for the second half, I am having more difficulty. For my complete visual argument, I want my first image (as described above) side by side with my second image, described as “fish in market” on my Git. I was able to get my words onto this image, but because I wasn’t able to figure out how to put them side by side, I had to create them as two separate GIMP files.

The final image should read across as “what goes in the ocean goes in you”. With these two images (hopefully) side by side in my final draft, it will read across clearly, in the same color, same font, and same size. I want this visual to reach out into its audiences and grab them. The argument being made is clear: if we pollute our waters, we are polluting ourselves. By treating these marine animals with harm, we are doing the same to ourselves. With so many fish in the oceans digesting plastic items like bags and straws, not only are they suffering, but what is in them is in us. What they digest, we digest. 

I am hoping with some help from Ben I can finally figure out how to place the two GIMP files side by side. I think this has something to do with the visual size (its measurements) of my file, and by enlarging it, I will be able to see both on one file.
